                My name is Harry Hamlin and I'm a business leader in the Pacific Northwest. My professional passions
                include a desire to foster growth and mentorship, specifically through the systematic implementation and
                execution of efficient systemization. My work styles are big-picture oriented, I'm confident and
                collaborative, and adaptable to many workplace environments. I strive to provide value to the teams I am
                a part of and through collaboration, foster growth and forward progress. My inspirations come from
                successes from my work colleagues, my friends and my family. My interests include mountain biking,
                traveling, and cooking.

                I've spent the past 10 years working professionally in the outdoor industry. The first several years of
                my professional life were spent working as a shift supervisor on ski patrol at Crystal Mountain in
                Washington and a professional climbing guide internationally. Through my work, I was able to reach the
                summit of Everest, Lhotse, and Mt Rainier over 50 times. For the past 2 years I have worked as the
                director of operations at International Mountain Guides, managing the company's staff of over 50 guides
                and operations of all domestic and international expeditions. Throughout my experiences I've developed
                excellent leadership and problem solving skills as well as a desire to foster growth and mentorship.
                I've had the opportunity to execute many technical projects, including the creation and systematic
                implementation of a custom built registration system and a collaborative ATF compliant data collection
                system.
